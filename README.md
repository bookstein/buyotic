USE CASE 1: PLEDGING
User receives an email about a campaign to support the brands that "do it right" -- the meat producers who are ethical and responsible and don't contribute to antibiotic resistance. The email comes from a nonprofit, friend, or other trusted source. A link leads to Buyotic.org. The link is also shared on social media.
The user clicks through and sees an online pledge to "change the industry," support the good guys, and buy ABF meat X times a month. They fill in X and take the pledge.
After taking the pledge, they are immediately taken to the meat finder.

USE CASE 2: MEAT FINDER**
User wants to go buy some antibiotic-free (ABF) meat at a local restaurant or grocery store for dinner. He/she pulls up the buyotic webpage on a desktop computer or phone and selects "find meat."
Because people tend to shop for specific kinds of meat, he/she chooses the kind of meat and enters a zip code and X-mile radius.
On submitting the information, the program returns a list of store chains or retailers that sell that product. User selects the store/retailer they want and app takes them to Google Maps with the address pre-filled in (searching for "nearby [store chain/restaurant]").
If user selects a retailer, an email is sent to their inbox asking them to confirm that they found the product or not (see use case 4). In the body of the email is a simple Yes or No. Clicking there will send the information back to the app.
If only 1 or 0 places are listed within the X-mile radius, the program pops up a "send a message" dialog. "Can't find what you want? Demand that retailers sell antibiotic-free meat!"

USE CASE 3: CAN'T FIND THE MEAT***
User is at the grocery store or is searching from home for ABF meat. They don't see the right meat in the store or they don't see the listing online. Frustrated and angry, they click "send a message" on their desktops or phones.
Using their GPS location (phones) or by asking the user to select the store they're at (or angry at), the app generates a pre-filled tweet or email targeted at either the company twitter handle or at the store manager.
The user modifies the message (if they want) and then sends it.
The app asks for permission to share the message on Buyotic. If the user agrees, they are taken to the Buyotic page and see their message on a "wall" of support from other users.
A pop-up asks if they'll share their action with others in their social networks. If they agree, a dialog allows them to share to FB or Twitter or other.

USE CASE 4: CROWDSOURCING THE MEAT DATA
User is in grocery store. They see ABF meat with specific certifications on it. They pull out their phone and navigate to the iPhone app or the web app.
OR: user is at home checking email and sees the email from Buyotic asking them to confirm sighting.
They hit a button "confirm sighting" and select the meat type and the store location from the options (narrowed down using GPS if on phone).
That store now has crowdsourced data that an ABF meat product exists there. Other users will see that information along with "last confirmed" date.

END GOAL:
Build a buycott for producers, brands, and restaurants who do it right.
Applegate, Chipotle, and others.
Promote these brands --> get retailers to stock them or create store ABF brands --> put pressure on large producers like Tyson to change.
