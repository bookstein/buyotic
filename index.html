          Without giving anything up, you and one million moms can protect your kids from drug-resistant superbugs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The future of meat is at a tipping point... and we’re starting with chicken. Poultry farmers already know they don't need to feed antibiotics to healthy chickens -- endangering American families by creating drug-resistant superbugs. Who will prove to them that we don’t need to play chicken with our children's health?
        </p>
        <p>
          We will.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Here's what YOU can do:
        </h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Buy affordable, responsibly-raised certified chicken at a grocery store near you. <a href="find.html">We’ll help you find it.</a></li>
          <li>Did you find delicious chicken at a great price? Share with friends who care and reward the farmers that are doing it right!</li>
          <li>Your grocery store doesn’t carry antibiotic-free chicken? Send a message to the management and <a href="demand.html">add your voice to a million-mom collective tweet.</a></li>
        </ol>

          Buycott the good guys -- and make everyone want to get on board.
        </p>
        <p>
          With our voices combined, we will convince grocery stores to stock healthy meats and reward responsible farmers. By acting together, we will make healthy, drug-free chicken available to everyone.
